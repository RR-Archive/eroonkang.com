Allan Sekula (January 15, 1951 – August 10, 2013) was an American artist, of Polish descent, photographer, writer, filmmaker, theorist and critic based at the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California, known as "CalArts". His work frequently focused on large economic systems, or "the imaginary and material geographies of the advanced capitalist world."


===== TEUs =====
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization

Containerization is a system of intermodal freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers and ISO containers) made of weathering steel. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The system, developed after World War II, reduced transport costs, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was an element in globalization.

===== Omnipresent and Omniscient =====

"We have all heard about the supersonic planes crossing the Atlantic in an hour and a half. Our astronauts are crossing the Atlantic in about 15 minutes. Suppose now that a plane were developed that could shuttle back and forth between London and New York in half a minute. Imagine yourself asking the stewardess on such a plane as to your whereabouts. She will say: "We have momentarily left New York — we are approaching London — oops! We are on our way back to New York." Clearly, our question makes no sense. We may just have to accept the fact that we are somehow in both places more or less at once.

Now suppose that we build a vehicle that can travel almost as fast as light. This means that we could go around our planet about seven times per second. This allows us to see practically any point on our globe within a second. And the people on the earth may see us always at one point or another, so that we are forming a shell of "presence" around the earth. 

Let's now visualize that we move at almost infinite speeds. Then it's easy to see that we can go around and through our solar system (or galaxy, or universe, for that matter) many times a second, thus weaving a tight pattern throughout that system. We could see everything there is to see and be everywhere in practically no time at all. In other words, we would have become //omnipresent//.

After the novelty of being omnipresent has worn off, and we have become accustomed to the high speeds, we feel that it is insufficient just to whiz around so fast. We would also like to know what goes on in our solar system. For that we have to invent a very rapid information-processing computer, which we can build cheaply and quickly in our imagination. We can absorb all the information about the solar system as it comes in. We are now not only //omnipresent// but //omniscient//."

===== Universal Product Code =====
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code

{{http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/UPC-A-036000291452.png?200}}

The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology (i.e., a specific type of barcode) that is widely used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and in other countries for tracking trade items in stores. Its most common form, the UPC-A, consists of 12 numerical digits, which are uniquely assigned to each trade item. Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications.[1] UPC data structures are a component of GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers). All of these data structures follow the global GS1 specification which bases on international standards. Some retailers (clothing, furniture) do not use the GS1 System (other bar code symbologies, other article number systems). Other retailers use the EAN/UPC bar code symbology but without using a GTIN (for products brands sold at such retailers only).
