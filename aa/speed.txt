===== Five Minutes City. Architecture and (Im)mobility Forum & Workshop Rotterdam =====
Dutch architect and urban designer Winy Maas posed a provocative question to a workshop for young architects: Could they redesign the cities of Rotterdam and New York so that everything could be reached within five minutes? This book looks at the responses to such a challenging brief, and the answers will surprise anyone who has considered the form of the modern city.

===== James Gleick, Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything (1999) =====

Most of us suffer some degree of "hurry sickness." a malady that has launched us into the "epoch of the nanosecond," a need-everything-yesterday sphere dominated by cell phones, computers, faxes, and remote controls. Yet for all the hours, minutes, and even seconds being saved, we're still filling our days to the point that we have no time for such basic human activities as eating, sex, and relating to our families. Written with fresh insight and thorough research, Faster is a wise and witty look at a harried world not likely to slow down anytime soon.

"//You cite Robert Kanigel, who wrote, "each day we reap the material benefits of the cult of workplace efficiency . . . yet we chafe -- we scream, we howl, we protest -- at the psychic chains in which it grips us." What do you think accounts for this contradiction?//"

"Robert Kanigel's quote is from his biography of Frederick Taylor, the man who is responsible for our modern notion of workplace efficiency. The idea of "efficiency experts" coming around with stopwatches timing workers in various tasks basically goes back to him. I quoted Kanigel because I think he was extremely perceptive about our ambivalent regard for "efficiency." On the one hand we hate it. I'm sure that you recoiled when I described this workplace efficiency expert with a stopwatch -- it's an evil image. It's hard to imagine that it makes anybody's working life better. So you can understand the temptation toward nostalgia for a different kind of work environment, one where the quality of your experience mattered, maybe. But I think there is ambivalence about it. The fact is we're the ones who are filling the world with efficiency experts. And we do it because we reap the benefits, and because our modern economic life depends on it. I think it would be wrong and blind for us to think we're just victims."
===== Speed and Politics =====
Speed and Politics (first published in France in 1977) is the matrix of Virilio's entire work. Building on the works of Morand, Marinetti, and McLuhan, Virilio presents a vision more radically political than that of any of his French contemporaries: **speed as the engine of destruction**. Speed and Politics presents a topological account of the entire history of humanity, honing in on the technological advances made possible through the militarization of society. Paralleling Heidegger's account of technology, Virilio's vision sees **speed--not class or wealth--as the primary force shaping civilization**. In this "technical vitalism," multiple projectiles--inert fortresses and bunkers, the "metabolic bodies" of soldiers, transport vessels, and now information and computer technology--are launched in a permanent assault on the world and on human nature. Written at a lightning-fast pace, Virilio's landmark book is a split-second, overwhelming look at how humanity's motivity has shaped the way we function today, and what might come of it.

==== Dromology ====
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio#Dromology

‘Dromos’ is the Greek noun for road, but Virilio takes it to mean the activity of race (Virilio 1977:47). It is with this meaning in mind that he coins the term 'dromology', which he defined as the "science (or logic) of speed“. Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He notes that **the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower**. 'Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.' [3]
===== Taylorism / Fordism =====

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordism

Fordism is **"the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them"**.[2] It has also been described as **"a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor"**.[3] Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, this principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

===== Ed Burtynsky, Manufactured Landscapes =====
{{youtube>ie5SJ39LsDg}}

The film involves the photographs and videos of photographer and visual artist Ed Burtynsky's trip through landscapes that have been altered by large-scale human activity, captured with Super-16mm film.[1] Most of the photographs featured in the film are pieces that are exhibited all over the world are taken with a "large format field camera on large 4x5-inch sheet film and developed into high-resolution, large-dimension prints (of approximately 50x60 inches)"[2] While some would some call the his work beautiful, his main goal was to challenge notions while raising questions about the of interplay of environmental ethics and aesthetics. The footage was compiled from a trip to China where Burtynsky visited factories which Western society has come to rely on for most of its appliances, including a factory that produces most of the world's supply of clothes irons, which is one kilometer in length and employs 23 000 workers. The film also features the Three Gorges Dam which, along with being the largest dam in the world, has uprooted more than one million people and flooded 13 cities, 140 towns and 1350 villages since the beginning of its construction in 1994.[3] Unlike most documentaries there is very little commentary which serves to allow the viewer to take in the images and try to make sense of what they're seeing, while at the same time "it tries to shift our consciousness about the world and the way we live in it".

Indeed, one of the few things about the building that suggested it was not a meth lab was that, at sunrise, the parking lot was full -- shifts begin at 3 a.m. The busiest time is around 7 a.m., but as I entered, the first thing I noticed was how silent it was. No one was chatting. The second thing I noticed was how, for a Web-based business, there were few computers -- maybe seven in the building, which has towering white walls and a concrete floor. Every Netflix warehouse looks like every other Netflix warehouse, down to the same flat, bright wattage of its light bulbs. It's not attractive, which might explain the hasty mismatch of promotional posters taped to its walls like college dorm decor -- a poster for "Atonement" alongside a poster for the direct-to-video "Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief" alongside a horror flick poster.

There's no there there, by design.

Forty-two people work here, nearly every one in a red Netflix T-shirt, nearly every one in constant motion. Indeed, I was asked not to disturb their groove and hit them up with questions. The busiest sat in wide rows, flanked with post office cartons stuffed with Netflix envelopes.

===== Stalking the wild pendulum (again) =====

{{screen_shot_2013-10-03_at_2.09.12_am.png?400}}

Let us analyze the motion of the pendulum. As it approaches its point of rest, it slows down more and more; eventually, it stops and starts moving in the opposite direction. The laws of classical mechanics tell us that at the point of rest the acceleration of the body is maximum; its potential energy is maximum; its velocity is zero; and the time required for changing the velocity of the pendulum is zero. If we analyze the events taking place at the zero point from the point of view of quantum mechanics, we get a 'different picture. Let us view the pendulum bob as a mathematical point, that is, a point that is too small to be measured (a dimensionless point) and follow its progress as it slows down. Clearly, the point will cover a smaller and smaller distance per unit time as it approaches its turning point. But quantum mechanics tell us that when distances go below Planck's distance, which is 10 ~33 cm., we enter, in effect, a new world. The causal relationship between events breaks down; movements become jerky rather than smooth. Time and space may become "grainy" or "chunky." Perhaps a piece of space can be traversed by a particle of matter in any direction without necessarily being synchronized with a piece of time. In short, a pair of events would occur in either time or space, the pair not being connected causally but by a random fluctuation. Suppose, indeed, that a material point can traverse space without necessarily requiring any chunk of time for the process. Should this happen, then a chunk of space has been spanned without any time elapsing. If we divide that tiny piece of distance to zero time, we find that the event occurred at infinite velocity. In other words, when we move through space without using up time, no matter over how short a distance, that event occurs at infinite velocity!
